# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
I was tasked with creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  Unsupervised machine learning was the model utilized in this analysis.

Deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Technology Used & Resources:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- crypto_data.csv

## Results:
I utilized the code initially outlined in the crypto starter file provided; I added additional code to complete the [crypto_clustering.ipynb] (https://github.com/Jahill17/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) file.

- The first deliverable required preprocessing the data for PCA. See the below screenshot for the results

- The second deliverable required reducing the data dimensions using PCA
